# SnakeRL: Q-Learning Model for Snake Game

## Overview

SnakeRL is a Python implementation of a reinforcement learning model trained to play the classic Snake game using Q-learning and the Bellman equation as the loss function. The project utilizes Pygame for game simulation, PyTorch for the Q-network implementation, and Q-learning for training the agent.

## Features

- Q-learning model with Bellman equation as the loss function for Snake game.
- Pygame integration for game simulation.
- PyTorch implementation for the Q-network.
- Customizable hyperparameters and settings for training.

## Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models are available in the `models` directory for quick testing.
